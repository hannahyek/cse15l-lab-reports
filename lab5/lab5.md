# Lab Report 5

My favorite lab report that I've completed for CSE 15L is the very first report. 

I completed the task of explaining how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6 by making my first ever repository and github pages site.
While I did not pass this report on the first try, the feedback and markdown skills I learned through making the report has helped me throughout the rest of the course.
Particularly, this task was my favorite as I got to explore all the different creative options to display the information (even adding a cute cat picture at the end of my report).
The actual tasking of logging into a course-specific account is used every week since I have written the lab report and I am glad I have learned this fundamental knowledge needed to pass this course.

Thanks!
